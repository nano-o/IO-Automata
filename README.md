# IO-Automata
Formalisation of basic IO-Automata theory in Isabelle/HOL.
Allows proving that an IO-Automaton implements another using a simulation relation.

IOA.thy formalizes IO-Automata, their executions and traces.
Simulations.thy formalizes and proves the soundness theorems for refinement mappings, forward simulations, and backward simulations.
